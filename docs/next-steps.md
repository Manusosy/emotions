# Next Steps for Authentication Migration

This document outlines the remaining tasks and improvement opportunities for the Emotions App after the successful authentication migration from Supabase to a custom cookie-based authentication system.

## ✅ Completed Cleanup Tasks

### 1. Refactoring Components Using Error Handling Utilities
- ✅ Updated `NewJournalEntryPage.tsx` to use `fetchWithErrorHandling` and environment-aware logging utilities (`errorLog`, `devLog`)

### 2. LocalStorage Usage Review
- ✅ Refactored `MoodMentorDashboard.tsx` to store welcome dialog shown status in the user's profile instead of localStorage

### 3. Environment Configuration
- ✅ Created documentation (`environment-config.md`) explaining how to update the environment configuration to remove Supabase variables

## Remaining Medium Priority Tasks

### 1. Continue Refactoring Components Using Error Handling Utilities
Several components still need to be updated to use the standardized error handling utilities:

- `BookingPage`: Update to use `fetchWithErrorHandling` consistently
- `SettingsPage`: Replace direct error handling with standardized utilities
- Components using `console.error/log`: Replace with `errorLog/devLog`

### 2. Continue LocalStorage Usage Review
While we've refactored the welcome dialog status in MoodMentorDashboard, some components still use localStorage:

- `SettingsPage`: Using localStorage for form persistence
- `BookingPage`: Using localStorage for booking data
- `AppointmentsPage`: Using localStorage for debug mode

Consider replacing these with:
- Session storage where appropriate
- Backend storage for persistent data
- Context API for state that needs to be shared

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Complete updating `.env` file to remove Supabase configuration (once permissions are granted)

## Lower Priority Tasks

### 1. Testing

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Create tests for `auth.service.ts`
  - Create tests for `notificationService.ts`
  - Create tests for `messageService.ts`

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test protected routes
  - Test authentication flows (login, logout, token refresh)
  - Test real-time updates with notification service

### 2. Documentation Updates

- Update README.md with current architecture
- Create architecture diagrams showing the new authentication flow
- Document error handling patterns

### 3. Production Monitoring

- Set up monitoring for authentication failures
- Implement logging for critical errors
- Create dashboard for auth metrics

## Technical Debt

These items should be addressed to improve code quality:

1. **Type Consistency**:
   - Ensure consistent typing across components
   - Remove any usage of `any` types

2. **Code Duplication**:
   - Identify and refactor duplicate code
   - Create shared utility functions

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Review component rendering performance
   - Optimize notification service polling

## Future Enhancements

1. **WebSockets for Real-time Updates**:
   - Replace polling with WebSockets for true real-time communication
   - Create a WebSocket wrapper compatible with the notification service API

2. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
   - Add IP-based suspicious activity monitoring

3. **Offline Support**:
   - Add offline capabilities using service workers
   - Implement conflict resolution for offline changes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: High-Priority Items (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Migrate authentication from Supabase to cookie-based system
- ✅ Update all components to use new authentication system
- ✅ Standardize error handling patterns

### Phase 2: Medium-Priority Items (In Progress)
- ✅ Start refactoring components to use error handling utilities
- ✅ Start reviewing and updating localStorage usage
- ✅ Create documentation for environment configuration
- ⬜ Complete all medium-priority refactoring tasks

### Phase 3: Lower Priority Items (Not Started)
- ⬜ Add basic unit tests for critical services
- ⬜ Update remaining documentation
- ⬜ Set up basic production monitoring

### Phase 4: Future Enhancements (Based on roadmap)
- ⬜ Implement WebSockets
- ⬜ Enhance security features
- ⬜ Add offline support
